#This project is created for STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller(Blue Pill board)

in this project, USART1 of the microcontroller is activated and then is used for transmitting and receiving data. To communicate with USART1 we can use a TTL to USB converter and we can control the communication on computer by using a Serial Terminal(such Real Term)

Pin map:
PortA.pin9 is used for USART1.TX
PortA.pin10 is used for USART1.RX
