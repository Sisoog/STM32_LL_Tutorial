#This project is created for STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (Blue Pill board)

In this project, SPI1 of the microcontroller is activated and then is used for transmitting data, that is sending arrays to display figures on a Nokia 5110 serial LCD. 

Pin map:
PortA.pin3 is used for LDC_Reset
PortA.pin4 is used for LDC_DC
PortA.pin5 is used for SPI1_SCK
PortA.pin7 is used for SPI1_MOSI
