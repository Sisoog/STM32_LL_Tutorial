#This project is created for STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller(Blue Pill board)

in this project, USART1 of the microcontroller is activated and an arbitrary word (KAMIN) is transmitted throuth USART1.TX. this data can be received by a TTL to USB converter and we can see it on computer by using a Serial Terminal(such Real Term)

the article and complete guidance for the code in this project can be found in sisoog.com :
