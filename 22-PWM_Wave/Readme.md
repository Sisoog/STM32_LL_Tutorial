<h1> Example project for Using PWM to generate different wave forms </h1>
<b> This project is created for STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (Blue Pill board) </b>

In this project, timer 1  of the microcontroller is activated and then configured in PWM mode, then is used to generate different wave forms on Pin8 of port A.
