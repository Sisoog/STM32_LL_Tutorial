#This project is created for STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (Blue Pill board)

in this project, ADC1 of the microcontroller is activated and is configured in Continuous Coversion Mode receive and convert data on pins in0 and in1. In this project DMA (Direct Memory Access) unit is used to manage the data transmission. 

Pin map:
PortA.pin0 is used for ADC1.in0 
PortA.pin0 is used for ADC1.in1
PortA.pin9 is used for USART1.TX
PortA.pin10 is used for USART1.RX
