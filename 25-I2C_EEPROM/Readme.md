<h1> Example project for using I2C </h1>
<b> This project is created for STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (Blue Pill board) </b>

In this project, I2C1 of the microcontroller is activated and then is used to write to and read from a 256 KB EEPROM.

| Pin map     | Function    |

| PortA.pin10  | USART1_RX    |
| PortB.pin6   | I2C1_SCL     |
| PortB.pin7   | I2C1_SDA     |
