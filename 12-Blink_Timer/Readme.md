<h1> Example project for LED Blink, using Timer Interrupt </h1>
<b>This project is created for STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (Blue Pill board)</b>

in this project the same actions as the Blink project is done, but this time timer interrupt is used in doing so.
pin13 of the portC of the Micro alternatingly is set to Vdd and Gnd(whit 500ms delay)، so the LED that is connected to this pin is turned-on and off accordingly.
